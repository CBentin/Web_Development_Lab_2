                        <p>
                            In the Hackathon, my team and I created an enhanced cane for the blind with array of different sensors. 
                            The propose of the cane is to facilitate the navigation of the blind with an integrated compass and proximity 
                            sensors to identify stairs, walls, etc. The cane was programed in Arduino.
